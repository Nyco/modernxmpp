# Terminology

To reduce user confusion when switching between clients, it is good to use only recommended
terms.

| Historic terms                   | Recommended terms                                     |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| MUC, Room, Chatroom, Conference  | *Group chat* or *Channel* (see [Multi-user Chats][])  |
| Occupant                         | *Participant*                                         |
| JID                              | *Address* or *XMPP address*                           |
| Roster                           | *Contact list*                                        |

## Translation

Most XMPP Clients are distributed in multiple languages. In the process of translating a client, people with various backgrounds (not necessarily XMPP-related) are contributing translations.
This table of terms (German, French and Spanish to begin with) aims to be a reference for recommended translations in the future.

At the moment, this table intends to support discussing the translation of key terms. [Discuss with us!](xmpp:modernxmpp@rooms.modernxmpp.org?join)
