# Modern XMPP documentation site

This site aims to be [a one-stop reference](https://docs.modernxmpp.org/) for implementing XMPP in modern times.

It is far from complete. PRs welcome!

## Building the site

Requirements: `mkdocs (> 1.0)`

To build the site simply run `mkdocs build`, or to serve a live version in your browser, `mkdocs serve`.
